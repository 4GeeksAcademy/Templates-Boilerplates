You cannot create a `.env` file on Heroku, instead you need to manually create all the variables under your project settings.

Open your `.env` file and copy and paste each variable (FLASK_APP, DB_CONNECTION_STRING, etc.) to Heroku.


## Deploying your database to Heroku (takes 3 minutes)

You local MySQL Database now has to be uploaded to a cloud, there are plenty of services that provide MySQL database hosting but we recomend JawDB because it has a Free Tier, its simple and 100% integrated with Heroku.

1. Go to your heroku project dashboard and look to add a new heroku add-on.
2. Look for JawDB MySQL and add it to your project (it may ask for a Credit Card but you will not be charged as long as your remain withing 5mb database size, enough for your demo.
3. Once JawDB is added to your project look for the Connection String inside your JawDB dashboard, something like:
```
mysql://tqqa0ui0cga32nxd:eqi8nchjbpwth82v@c584md9egjnm02sk.5btxwkvyhwsf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/45fds423rbtbr
```
4. Copy the connection string and create a new environment variable on your project settings.
5. Run migrations on heroku: After your database is connected, you have to create the tables and structure, you can do that by running the `pipenv run upgrade` command on the production server like this:
```
$ heroku run -a=<your_app_name> pipenv run upgrade
```
:warning: Note: Notice that you have to replace `<your app name>` with your application name, you also have to be logged into heroku in your terminal (you can do that by typing `heroku login -i`)
