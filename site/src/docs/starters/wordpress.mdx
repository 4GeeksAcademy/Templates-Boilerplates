### - Adding API endpoints
This boilerplate comes with a sample API endpoint already, all API endpoints can be added into the **setup_api.php** file like this:
```php
// adding a GET /courses endpoint handled by the function getDraftCourses in the SampleController.php file
$api->get([ 'path' => '/courses', 'controller' => 'SampleController:getDraftCourses' ]);
```
Here is more info on [how to create the API endpoints](https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash/tree/master/src/WPAS/Controller#creating-an-apis-using-mvc).

### - Adding Entities (Post Types)
All the Post Types configuration is done in the **setup_types.php** file like this:

```php
// adding Post Type "Course" handled by the file Course.php
$typeManager->newType(['type' => 'course', 'class' => 'Course'])->register();
```
Here is more info on [how to create the post-types](https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash/tree/master/src/WPAS/Types).
