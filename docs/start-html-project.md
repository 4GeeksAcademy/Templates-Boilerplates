## What to do next?

Create a `index.html` file with the [basic HTML structure](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-html-learn-html#page-structure) and see it live by running web-server using the following command:

```bash
pip install flask && python server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files you want.
- You can also create CSS files and you can import them onto your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
```
