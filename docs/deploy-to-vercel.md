# Deployment Guide to Vercel

This file will guide you through the steps to deploy your React application on Vercel using Vite. Follow these steps to ensure your project is deployed correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the deployment, make sure that:

1. You have an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. You have Git installed on your machine.
3. The project is set up correctly on your local machine and is already using Vite for building.

## Step 1: Connect your repository to Vercel

1. Go to your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
2. Click on the **"New Project"** button.
3. Select **GitHub** as the repository provider and authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account.
4. Choose the repository where your project is stored and click **"Import"**.

Vercel will automatically detect that you're using a Vite project and configure the build settings for you.

## Step 2: Deploy your project

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your project every time you push to your repository. However, you can also manually trigger a deployment if you prefer.

### Step 3: Additional configuration (Optional)

#### 3.1. Custom domains

If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., my-site.com), you can set it up in the Vercel control panel:

- Go to your project page in Vercel.
- Go to **Settings**.
- Select the **Domains** section.
- Add your custom domain and follow Vercel's instructions to set it up.

#### 3.2. Environment variables

If you need to set up environment variables (e.g., API keys), you can do it from Vercel's configuration panel:

- Go to **Settings** of your project.
- Go to the **Environment Variables** section.
- Add the necessary variables for your project.

## Step 4: Monitor and maintain

Once your project is deployed on Vercel, you can use Vercel's tools to monitor your app's performance and logs.

- **Logs**: Check the build and runtime logs in Vercel's dashboard for errors or issues.
- **Dashboard**: Access traffic metrics, response times, and other important details.
